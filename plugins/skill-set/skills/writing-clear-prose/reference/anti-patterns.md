## Drafting Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Problem | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| **Burying the lead** | Key point appears in paragraph 3+ | Move conclusion to first paragraph |
| **Hedge stacking** | "might possibly perhaps" | One hedge maximum per claim |
| **Synonym drift** | Calling the same thing "system", "platform", "solution" | Pick one term, use it consistently |
| **Abstraction cascade** | Each sentence more abstract than the last | Ground every abstract claim with a concrete example |
| **Kitchen sink** | Including everything to seem thorough | Cut anything that doesn't serve the document's purpose |
| **Throat clearing** | Opening with background the reader already knows | Start where the reader's knowledge ends |

## Revision Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Problem | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| **Style-first revision** | Polishing sentences before fixing structure | Always revise structure first (see `revising.md`) |
| **Rewriting instead of editing** | Generating new text rather than cutting | Editing = subtracting; draft new text only to fill structural gaps |
| **Consistency blindness** | Ignoring terminology drift during revision | Ctrl+F each key term; verify consistent usage |
| **Feedback accumulation** | Collecting feedback without acting on it | Process feedback in real-time, one pass per category |

## Rationalization Table

If you catch yourself thinking these, stop and apply the relevant principle.

| Thought | Reality | Principle |
|---|---|---|
| "The reader will understand what I mean" | They won't. Be explicit. | Concreteness |
| "This sounds more professional" | Jargon without explanation excludes readers. | Transcreation |
| "The counter-argument is too weak to mention" | If it's that weak, steel-manning it costs nothing. | Steel Man |
| "I need this sentence for flow" | Flow comes from structure, not filler. | Brevity |
| "Adding more detail shows thoroughness" | Unnecessary detail obscures the point. | Brevity |
| "I should hedge to be safe" | Over-hedging signals uncertainty, not caution. | Brevity |
